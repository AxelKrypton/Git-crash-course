# Git Trilogy

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

This three-parts, crash course should bring the newbie from not knowing what git is and how to use it to a comfortable knowledge level about it.
Some practice from the attenddee is clearly required and necessary to make this material useful and in order to make git part of the own toolbox.

## Part 1

After some general introduction and motivation about why a version control system and in particular git should be daily used, this presentation will focus on how to use it locally in a daily flow.
Slides contain lots of examples that can be used as exercise to become acquainted with this wonderful tool.

## Part 2

We are now ready to learn how to use git to collaborate in the same project with different people or simply how to contribute to the same project from different machines.

**NOTE:** The live example has been a demonstration about how to use branches, trigger and solve a conflict when this course has been given.
It was basically a demonstration of the content of the previous slides and doing so can also be a good offline exercise for the attendee.
Analogously, the conclusive live exercise has been taylored to the audience, but it is still possible to do some practice using/cloning an own test repository.

## Part 3

Knowing most of git commands, it is now time to bring our git usage to another level.
After having explored how to rebase and tag git history, a very common branching pattern is here introduced and discussed.
